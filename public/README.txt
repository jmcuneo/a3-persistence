Design Achievements for A3:



- Single Page App: Data updates without refreshing the page (the A2 version of this page needed to refresh)

- Database Security: The app was specifically designed that no easy loopholes
  exist to possibly modify the clientside script to use/view another user's data
  (all post/get requests require the user's login information)

- Database uses more than one Collection: Insted of attaching data to a user,
  data receives a key from the user when entered the database, and can be queried using the keyword
  (only when the user is logged in is the query allowed)

- Buttons are added in the table for Dates: For convince, you may click on a date to make it
  autofill in the text input for date

- 100 in all 4 lighthouse tests: Final commit of this project passed all 4 lighthouse tests at 100
