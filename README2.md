This assignment was definitely the most challenging for me so far. I iterated over my A2 concept to implement all of the new features required for A3.
The guides posted on the class github were very helpful to me, I started with some code from the guide and glitch example, 
and made changes as I needed. MongoDB ended up being the most straightforward part of the assignment for me, as I am very 
familiar with using databases in my projects. The login system ended up being the hardest by far, and my implementation was
unable to achieve password storing. I tried making another cluster in my database to store user accounts, but I ended up running
out of time to properly implement it, so for my project, all users must use 'test' as their password. Other than that, I was able 
to achieve projects being associated with user accounts, and only being able to see and remove projects associated with a logged in user.
While I was unable to achieve everything I wanted with this assignment, I still feel that I learned a lot and made a lot of progress in 
my web development skills. I work much better in team environments, where I am not responsible for every last detail, and I hope to be able to
use my knowledge effectively in the final project.
