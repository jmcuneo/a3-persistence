## A Simple Todo List

https://a3-stephenfanning.onrender.com/

This application is a very simple to-do list that lets you keep track of tasks. Simply type the details of the task and click "Submit". You can enter the same task (but with different course, due date, or add date values) to modify existing entries in the list, and you can press "Clear" to delete them all. The Todo list is also user-specific.

Given my limited experience (none) in web development, I intentionally kept a very narrow scope for this project. A simple username and password is used for authentication, and the data for this is simply stored in the server's memory since it was easy to implement.

I utilized Picnic CSS as my CSS framework since it seemed quite easy to use, and the visuals fit the application.

No external packages were used besides the Express functionality shown in lecture.

I experienced a surprising amount of difficulty with hosting the site, since I initially tried Vercel, and it was giving a multitude of errors that were difficult to troubleshoot given my limited experience. Thankfully, Render proved much easier to use.
