## A Simple To-Do List
https://a2-stephenfanning.glitch.me
This application is a very simple to-do list that lets you keep track of tasks. Simply type the details of the task and click "Submit".
It also adds the date at which an element was added to the list. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Single Page**: The entire application is contained within a single page.
- **Modifiable**:  Simply enter a task with the same task name (and perhaps a different course or due date), 
                   and it will update the existing item instead of adding a new one.
