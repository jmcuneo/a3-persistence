### Summary
The goal of this application was to create a game manager to let users store the teams and scores of their games.
It stores data unique to each user, and allows any user to add or remove other users. 
This application starts with one set of credentials (username, password) that can be used to interact with the 
application. There were no major problems that I encountered, it simply took me longer than I expected to get everything
working properly. I simply stored a username and password in the database ass it was the most straightforward way to handle
authentication. To style the application, I used tailwind. This took some time to learn, but I found that once I learned
it, it was much easier to develop with than pure CSS.
