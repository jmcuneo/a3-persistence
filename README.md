## Simple To-Do List

http://a3-parkerfrizzle.glitch.me

- Goal: A simple to-do list app that automatically prioritizes items by the time until they're due.
- Challenges:
  - I got hung up on some weird little errors while trying to implement Express and then later MongoDB that ate up a lot of my time.
  - Due to some personal circumstances I wasn't able to give this assignment nearly as much time as it needed and so it's unfortunately very half-baked as it stands.
- CSS framework: MVP.css
  - I picked this framework since it's lightweight and relies solely on semantic HTML so it worked right out of the box and I didn't have to spend time adding new classes to my HTML file. I also felt like its minimalistic and clean style fit the energy of my project pretty well.
  - The only modifications made were the custom colors in the to-do list that are picked by the user.
