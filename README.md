## Monthly Cost Tracker
https://a3-lucassicard.glitch.me/

#### Summary
This application records all the monthly expenses you give it. It will keep track of it on a remote MongoDB server & 
is protected via a password. You may enter an entirely new username & password to create a new account. You may also 
delete entries or update them via the buttons on the table. In order to update them, you need to fill out the form with 
the updated information & then click update next to the entry you desire to change. The application uses bootstrap for 
that is what I have used before & makes for a clean application. Authentication is controlled via cookies and checking 
with the database for correct password usage so that all the info is stored in one place.
