## Assignment 3 Ethan Moynihan

glitch link e.g. https://a3-ethanmoynihan-ffa5e709c487.herokuapp.com/


- the goal of this website is to mimic a food ordering application
- creating forms for add to order was difficult. It was also difficult to handle the database implementation
- I chose to use a password/user database because it seemed like it would be the simplest option, there is currently no protection on this so do not use sensitive passwords when testing the application
- Used the sakura framework because it is light and looks good
- App.get was used to redirect the webpage of the user 
- App.post was used for any data handling or interactions with the databases
## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I scored 100% on all 3 pages of my website with google lighthouse
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I hosted my website on heroku servers rather than glitch. Deployment was a little easier and the server has the ability to auto redeploy based on a github push which I think is really cool.
