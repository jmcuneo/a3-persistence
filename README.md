Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of this website is to mimic a food ordering application
- creating forms for add to order was difficult. It was also difficult to handle the database implementation
- I chose to use a password/user database because it seemed like it would be the simplest option, there is currently no protection on this so do not use sensitive passwords when testing the application
- Used the sakura framework because it is light and looks good\
- a list of Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function, please add a little more detail about what it does.
- App.get was used to redirect the webpage of the user 
- App.post was used for any data handling or interactions with the databases
## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I scored 100% on all 3 pages of my website with google lighthouse
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I hosted my website on heroku servers rather than glitch. Deployment was a little easier and the server has the ability to auto redeploy based on a github push which I think is really cool.
### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: W3 design tips followed
- login error messages show descriptive message
- error messages are printed to an alert

- no images included
- language is used on all pages
- there is markup used to tell different parts of the pages
- Reading order is reflected in the code
- There is a difference between foreground and background
