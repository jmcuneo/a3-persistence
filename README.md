## To Do List

Link: https://a3-joselinbarbosa.glitch.me

I implemented a website that keeps track of your to do list. You can edit your to do list items and delete off your to do list once the task is complete. Something I had challenges with was the update feature and having these updates show up on the screen. I used the Picnic CSS framework because I thought it had a simple design and the documentation was easy to follow. In my custom CSS file I added padding to adjust the objects on the screen. I used session based authentication and have a dummy user and password, because it was easier to implement. If the user inputs the incorrect credentials, they get a message saying wrong user or password. As for Express middleware packages I used:
- express.static: used for static files
- body-parser: used to parse data from form in post requests
- express-session: used for login authentication

## Technical Achievements
- **Login**: Implemented login page with a dummy account, and an error message if user inputs wrong user/password
- **Lighthouse**: all four tests got 100%

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **CRAP principles**: I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative:
- *C*:I used black and blue consistently throughout my website. Black was used for text and blue was used for the buttons and main elements such as the results table. I used a clear to read font I obtained from Google Fonts and adjusted its size accordingly, small for body and large for headings. The blue elements definitely had the most contrast on my page. I originally had the buttons be bolder colors, such as red and orange. When I tested my website through the Page Insights, I noticed my Accessibility score was incredibly low due to the red and orange buttons I had. However the blue color use on my site had a good rating, so I changed the colored elements to all be blue.
- *R*: As for repetition, I carried the same color scheme throughout my website. I decided to keep the style relatively simple. I used the same style of inputs for the login page as I did for my to do list. These consisted of the rounded rectangular boxes that came as an option in the Picnic CSS framework I decided to use. The buttons I used on my login page were also the same for the submit task feature, as well as for the delete and update features on the results table. I also decided to use the same font all throughout my website. Items in my website that had a white background, received black text, but items in my website that had a colored blue background, received white text. 
- *A*: When it comes to alignment, everything on my website is left aligned. From the boxes in the login page, to the submit a task section, and the table with the results. I decided to do this since during the peer feedback exercises I did for the last assignment, the two people I asked to review my site said that it was hard to see where to direct their attention to. Since the items on my website were either directly in the center or left aligned, they were confused as to where to find certain things. They were lost when it came to find where to add items to the do list. For this reason, I decided to keep the items in my site left aligned to avoid any confusion and to give a more neat appearance.
- *P*: For proximity I was conscious of how I grouped items. I kept the items that had to do with adding tasks to the to do list together with their accompanying labels. To display the current to do list I decided to display in the form of a table. This was users could neatly see the task, the priority and the due date all in the same line, rather than listing these out. I decided to place the update and delete task buttons next to their associated task on the to do table. This way users could easily see what task they were choosing to delete and what task they were choosing to update. I kept the login items close together as well on the login page.
